# turtle-crossing-start
A game where we control a turtle (our player) to cross a real busy road. When the player crosses the road correctly, the level of game increases by 1 and so as the score. With increase in level, the speed of cars 
also increases and that makes it difficult for our player to cross the road. Thereby makes the game harder. This is a fun and challenging game that becomes really difficult as the levels increase.
The game gets over when the player collides with the car.
